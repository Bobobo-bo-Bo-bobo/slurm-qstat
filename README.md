# Preface
`slurm-qstat` tries to display information about jobs, nodes and partitions of the SLURM queueing system

# Build requirements
This check is implemented in Go so, obviously, a Go compiler is required.
Additionally the [tablewriter](https://github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter) is required for the build.
