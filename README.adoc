== Preface

`slurm-qstat` tries to display information about jobs, nodes, partitions and reservations of the SLURM queueing system

== Build requirements

This tool is implemented in Go so, obviously, a Go compiler is required. Additionally the https://github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter[tablewriter] is required for the build.

== Command line parameters

[width="100%",cols="<31%,<45%,<24%",options="header",]
|===
|_Option_ |_Description_ |_Note_
|`--brief` |Show brief output |-
|`--filter=<part>,...` |Limit output of to the comma separated list of partitions |If not specified, information about jobs, nodes and partitions of all partitions will be displayed
|`--help` |Show the help text |
|`--jobs=<filter>` |List information about jobs |Filter is mandatory and can be one of
| | |`all` - show all jobs
| | |`not-running` - show not running jobs only
| | |`running` - show only running jobs
|`--nodes` |List information about nodes |
|`--partitions` |List information about partitions |
|`--reservations` |List information about reservations |
|`--sort=<sort>` |Sort output by field in ascending order |see documentation below
|`--version` |Show version information |
|===

=== Sorting output

Output can be sorted using the `--sort=<sort>` option. `<sort>` is a comma separated list of `<object>:<field>` `<object>` can be prefixed by a minus sign to reverse the sort order of the field and can be one of:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
